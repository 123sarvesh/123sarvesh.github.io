      <h2>Detection Algorithms</h2>
      <p>
        The success of face mask recognition systems depends not only on the
        models used but also on the algorithms that handle object detection and
        classification. Below are some of the most popular algorithms employed
        in face mask recognition.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. YOLO (You Only Look Once): YOLO is a fast object detection
          algorithm that processes an entire image in a single forward pass
          through the neural network. It divides the image into a grid and
          assigns bounding boxes and class probabilities to each grid cell. YOLO
          is widely used in real-time applications because of its speed. In the
          context of face mask recognition, YOLO can identify faces and classify
          them as either masked or unmasked in real time, making it highly
          effective in surveillance and monitoring systems.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          2. SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector): SSD is another efficient
          object detection algorithm that, like YOLO, performs object detection
          in a single pass. SSD improves on YOLO by using multiple feature maps
          of different resolutions to detect objects at varying scales. This
          makes it more accurate in detecting smaller objects, such as faces or
          masks in a crowded scene. SSD also uses anchor boxes to better capture
          aspect ratios and scales, leading to more accurate detection results
          in complex scenes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          3. Haar Cascade Classifier: The Haar Cascade Classifier is a machine
          learning-based approach for object detection, known for its simplicity
          and efficiency in detecting faces in an image. It uses a cascade of
          classifiers to identify objects by scanning the image at multiple
          scales and applying a series of filters. Although Haar Cascade is not
          as accurate as deep learning-based methods like YOLO or SSD, it is
          still useful for face detection in resource-constrained environments.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          4. Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is a technique that involves
          taking a pre-trained model (such as MobileNet or ResNet) and
          fine-tuning it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This approach
          saves time and computational resources, as the model has already
          learned general features from a large dataset. In face mask
          recognition, transfer learning allows developers to build robust
          models without the need for extensive labeled data, making it a highly
          practical approach.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        These algorithms form the backbone of modern face mask recognition
        systems, each offering a unique balance of speed and accuracy depending
        on the application.
