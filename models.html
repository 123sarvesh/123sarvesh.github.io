      <h2>Popular Models</h2>
      <p>
        For face mask recognition, several models can be employed depending on
        the trade-off between speed and accuracy. This section discusses some of
        the most effective models used in computer vision for this purpose.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. MobileNetV2: MobileNetV2 is a lightweight convolutional neural
          network (CNN) that excels in mobile and embedded vision applications.
          Its architecture is designed to maintain accuracy while significantly
          reducing the computational load, making it ideal for real-time face
          mask detection. The model employs depthwise separable convolutions,
          reducing the number of parameters without compromising on performance.
          Due to its efficiency, MobileNetV2 is a common choice for edge devices
          and mobile applications where computational resources are limited.

          2. ResNet (Residual Networks): ResNet is a deeper CNN architecture
          that solves the vanishing gradient problem through the use of skip
          connections, which allow the gradient to flow through the network more
          easily during backpropagation. This enables the network to have many
          more layers (e.g., 50, 101, or 152) without suffering from
          degradation. ResNet is particularly powerful in tasks that require
          high accuracy, such as face detection and mask recognition. However,
          its complexity makes it more resource-intensive compared to models
          like MobileNet.

          3. VGG16: VGG16 is a classic CNN model known for its simplicity and
          effectiveness in image classification and object detection. The
          network consists of 16 layers, primarily composed of convolutional
          layers followed by fully connected layers. While VGG16 is accurate, it
          is more computationally expensive than models like MobileNetV2 due to
          its large number of parameters, making it less ideal for real-time
          applications on low-power devices. Nonetheless, it remains a solid
          choice when computational resources are not a concern.

          4. InceptionNet: InceptionNet, also known as GoogleNet, introduces the
          concept of Inception modules, which allow the model to capture
          multi-scale features more efficiently. This is achieved by combining
          convolutional layers with different kernel sizes in the same block.
          InceptionNet can be useful for face mask recognition as it captures
          both global and local features effectively, allowing for robust
          detection under varying conditions such as lighting changes and
          partial occlusions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Each of these models can be fine-tuned using transfer learning
        techniques, where a pre-trained model is adapted to the specific task of
        mask detection. Transfer learning accelerates training and improves
        performance, especially when large labeled datasets are not readily
        available.
