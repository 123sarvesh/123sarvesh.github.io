      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The development of face mask recognition systems represents a
        significant achievement in computer vision, with the potential for broad
        applications beyond public health. Leveraging advanced models like
        MobileNetV2 and ResNet, combined with powerful algorithms such as YOLO
        and SSD, has made it possible to detect masks with high accuracy and
        speed, even in real-time scenarios. By incorporating preprocessing
        techniques, transfer learning, and data augmentation, these systems
        become highly adaptable, able to handle challenges like varying lighting
        conditions and occlusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the world continues to adapt to new safety norms, face mask
        recognition systems offer a scalable and efficient way to ensure
        compliance in high-traffic areas like airports, hospitals, and public
        venues. Beyond mask detection, the technology can extend to other
        domains such as security and safety monitoring, making it a versatile
        tool in the field of computer vision. The research and methodologies
        discussed here lay a solid foundation for continued innovation, ensuring
        that such systems remain effective and scalable in future challenges.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In conclusion, face mask recognition is not only a practical solution
        for enforcing mask mandates during a health crisis, but it also
        represents a significant step forward in the broader field of computer
        vision. The models and algorithms discussed in this project offer a
        flexible, scalable framework for tackling a wide range of object
        detection tasks, ensuring that the technology remains relevant and
        useful in a post-pandemic world. As we move forward, continued research
        and development in this area will only further enhance the capabilities
        of these systems, leading to more robust and adaptable solutions for
        public safety, security, and beyond.
