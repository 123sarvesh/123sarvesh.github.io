      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong
            >1. Which algorithm is commonly used for real-time object
            detection?</strong
          >
        </li>
        <p class="correct-answer">Answer: YOLO (You Only Look Once)</p>
        <p>
          YOLO is widely used for real-time object detection due to its ability
          to process images quickly and accurately, making it suitable for tasks
          like face mask recognition.
        </p>

        <li>
          <strong
            >2. Which model is often used for lightweight face mask recognition
            on mobile devices?</strong
          >
        </li>
        <p class="correct-answer">Answer: MobileNetV2</p>
        <p>
          MobileNetV2 is popular for lightweight applications due to its
          efficiency and low computational requirements, making it ideal for
          mobile device deployment.
        </p>

        <li>
          <strong
            >3. What is the main challenge in face mask recognition under
            real-world conditions?</strong
          >
        </li>
        <p class="correct-answer">Answer: Occlusion and lighting</p>
        <p>
          Occlusion (e.g., mask covering part of the face) and variations in
          lighting conditions pose significant challenges for accurate mask
          recognition.
        </p>

        <li>
          <strong
            >4. Which of the following is a preprocessing technique used in face
            mask detection?</strong
          >
        </li>
        <p class="correct-answer">Answer: Image flipping</p>
        <p>
          Image flipping is commonly used to augment data by creating mirrored
          versions of images, helping models generalize better in different
          scenarios.
        </p>

        <li>
          <strong
            >5. What is transfer learning used for in face mask
            recognition?</strong
          >
        </li>
        <p class="correct-answer">Answer: Reducing training time</p>
        <p>
          Transfer learning allows models to use pre-trained weights from large
          datasets, reducing the time needed to train new models for face mask
          detection.
