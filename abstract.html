      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Face mask recognition, as a subset of computer vision, has gained
        significant attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability to
        detect face masks in real time is essential for ensuring public safety
        in high-risk environments such as airports, hospitals, and public
        transport systems. This project aims to build an efficient, real-time
        face mask recognition system using deep learning models and computer
        vision algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system leverages state-of-the-art models like MobileNetV2, ResNet,
        and VGG16, which are known for their balance between performance and
        computational efficiency. These models, when combined with object
        detection algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot
        Multibox Detector), create a robust framework for detecting masks with
        high accuracy. The project also delves into the practical implementation
        of these models, addressing challenges like varying lighting conditions,
        occlusions, and scalability for large datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this system, preprocessing steps such as face detection and
        segmentation are applied before the recognition task. The project
        further explores how techniques like transfer learning can be employed
        to fine-tune pre-trained models, thus accelerating the development
        process while maintaining high accuracy. By examining these
        methodologies, this project provides a comprehensive guide to building
        and deploying face mask recognition systems in real-world environments.
